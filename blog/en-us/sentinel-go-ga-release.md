We're happy to announce that [Sentinel Go v1.0.0](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang/releases/tag/v1.0.0) has been released. This is a production-ready GA version with versatile fault-tolerance and flow control capabilities including rate limiting, concurrency limiting (semaphore isolation), throttling, circuit breaking, system adaptive protection and "hot-spot" traffic shaping. We've already provided [plugins for commonly-used frameworks](https://github.com/sentinel-group/sentinel-go-adapters) including Gin, go-micro, gRPC and dubbo-go. We've also made progress in cloud native evolution including Kubernetes CRD data-source, Kubernetes HPA based on Sentinel metrics and plugins for service meshes.
