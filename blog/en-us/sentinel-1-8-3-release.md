# Sentinel 1.8.3 Released

We're happy to announce that [Sentinel 1.8.3](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/releases/tag/v1.8.3) has been released with cool features including JMX metric exporter support. And we've brought [Envoy RLS v3 API support for Sentinel token server](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/tree/master/sentinel-cluster/sentinel-cluster-server-envoy-rls), which means we could do distributed rate-limiting with Sentinel in the latest Envoy releases.
